# Crash Landed

## Hello!
Crash landed is a very silly platform game about an alien who probably should have been watching where he was flying. It will run on Mac, Linux, and Windows. In theory it will run on Android too, but you won't be able to do anything, so probably don't bother?

It was writen as a tribute to Keney's amazing 2d art, and as a code learing exercise that spiraled horribly out of control.

It is... almost playable right now, known bugs and all. The tutorial level isn't, so you'll have to figure it out yourself. Then there are like two or three partly completed levels, the last of which is not completable. But some of them are pretty good! Even if we say so ourselves.

## How to run

Right now we are only distributing .love files, not executables. To run those you will need to download the l√∂ve app for your OS, from [here](https://love2d.org/). When you get that it will probably associate the .love file type with the app so you just need to double click and off to go! If not, I have no idea. Read the internet!

## How to play

Once you are in, the only keys are the cursor keys or WASD if you are a lefty; Esc to pause; and Space or Enter on the world screen and the menus. We are keeping it simple so we can try and make a mobile version!

## And now

What are you doing still reading this, play the game
