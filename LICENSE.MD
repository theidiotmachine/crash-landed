## Art

### Preamble

All the art in Crash-landed is licensed CC0. We would like to take this oppotunity
to thank the artists for the awesome work under this permsissive license. This
covers everything in the art folder and fonts folder.

### Kenney

Most of the art comes from Kenney. This is all licenced CC0. Kenney can be found
[here](http://www.kenney.nl).

### Alexandra Alarie

Some of the extra art comes from Alexandra Alarie aka [PINKCANNON](https://opengameart.org/users/pinkcannon).

### theidiotmachine

The rest of the art - remixes of the above, plus some original things -
is by me, and is also CC0. I will post to OGA in due course.

## Maps

All the level data -- in the 'maps' folder - are by us and are distributed under a [CC0 1.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). 
The .lua files in here are more like data than code so it seems to make more
sense.

Game design is by Tim Dinsdale, Freddie Dinsdale and Theo Dinsdale.

## Music

All the music is from the amazing [Kevin Macleod](incompetech.com)
